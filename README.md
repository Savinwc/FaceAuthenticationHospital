Created a patient registration App that aims to simplify the patient registration process and enhance security by utilizing facial recognition technology.
This app allows patients to securely upload their personal information and scanned photo fromt heir homes,eliminating the need for in-person registration at the hospital.
Upon the patient's arrival at the hospital, the facial recognition technology will quickly and accurately verify their identity
against the registration information already stored in the app
database. 
The use of facial recognition technology will enhance security measures by ensuring that only the registered patient is present at the hospital, and a token can be issued for queuing outside the relevant room. 

This solution should provide a convenient and secure alternative to traditional registration methods, improving the patient experience and enabling healthcare providers to deliver care moreÂ efficiently.
